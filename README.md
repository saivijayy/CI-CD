# CI-CD

CI/CD Pipeline for AWS ECS
Description
This project sets up a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions to automate the deployment of a web application to AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS). The pipeline includes automated deployment, integration tests, and rollback functionality. It leverages Docker for containerization and Nginx as a reverse proxy.

Enter your AWS credentials and default region.

Configuration
Set up GitHub Secrets:

Add the following secrets to your GitHub repository:

AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: Your AWS Access Key ID.
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: Your AWS Secret Access Key.
ECS_CLUSTER: The name of your ECS cluster.
ECS_SERVICE: The name of your ECS service.
ECS_TASK_DEFINITION: The name of your ECS task definition.
Go to Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions in your GitHub repository and add these secrets.

Create and Configure task-definition.json:

Ensure that the task-definition.json file is correctly configured and located in the root directory of your repository. This file defines your ECS task configuration.

Usage
Run the CI/CD Pipeline:

The pipeline is triggered automatically on pushes to the main branch. To manually trigger it, use the GitHub Actions tab in your repository.

Local Development:

To run the application locally, follow these steps:

bash
Copy code
docker build -t my-app .
docker run -p 80:80 my-app
Access the application at http://localhost.

Testing
Run Integration Tests:

Integration tests are included in the CI/CD pipeline and are executed automatically during deployment.

Local Testing:

To run tests locally:

bash
Copy code
npm test
Ensure that all required test dependencies are installed.

Deployment
Deploy to AWS ECS:

The deployment process is automated through GitHub Actions. Ensure that your AWS credentials and ECS configuration are correctly set up in the GitHub Secrets.

The workflow file is located in .github/workflows/deploy.yml.

Monitor Deployment Logs:

View the deployment progress and logs from the GitHub Actions tab in your repository.

Rollback
Automatic Rollback:

The pipeline includes automatic rollback functionality. In case of deployment failure, the previous stable version will be redeployed automatically.

Manual Rollback:

To manually roll back, use the AWS CLI or AWS Management Console to update the ECS service with a previous task definition:

bash
Copy code
aws ecs update-service --cluster my-cluster --service my-service --task-definition previous-task-definition
